Regeln = Which Tower?\nRules determining which tower a player moves:\n\
Rule T1: For the first move only in any round, the player making this move can select any of his/her eight dragon towers as the one to be moved.\n\
Rule T2: For all subsequent moves in that round (i.e. on any move except the first), each player must move the dragon tower that matches the colour of the square on which their opponent\u2019s previous move finished.\n\
Please note that this is a very important rule and it is vital that you understand it fully before you attempt to play Kamisado!\n\n\
Valid Moves?\nRules determining how that tower can be moved:\n\
Rule M1: A tower must be moved in a straight line, either directly forwards or diagonally forwards. No sideways or backwards moves are EVER allowed, except backwards moves made as a result of a \u2018Sumo push\u2019 (see later \u2013 not applicable to a Single Round match).\n\
Rule M2: A tower can be moved any number of squares, but may not pass through any square that already contains a tower (either belonging to the player making the move, or to his/her opponent).\n A tower can even be moved directly from a square in a player\u2019s own home row to an empty space in his/her opponent\u2019s home row, provided that this move is in a straight line and there are no towers on any of the squares the tower has to pass through.\n\
Rule M3: A tower can only be moved to a square that was previously empty (i.e. no two towers may ever occupy the same space).\n\
Rule M4: A tower is allowed to move diagonally between two dragon towers that occupy squares that touch corner-to-corner.\n\
Rule M5: A tower must be moved at least one square if it is at all possible to do so.\n\
Rule M6: If it is impossible to move the required tower in any way (i.e. if it is completely blocked from moving forwards or diagonally forwards), the player whose turn it is to move that tower has to miss that turn, and his/her opponent moves again immediately.\n\
Rule M7: The round finishes as soon as either player succeeds in moving one tower to any square within their opponent\u2019s 'home row'. That player has now 'won' that round.\n\
Rule M8: It is possible, although extremely unlikely, to get a situation where both players have towers which are completely blocked so that they cannot be moved, and for these towers to interact to form a 'deadlock' situation where no further towers can be moved at all. \nIn this situation, the player who made the last move prior to the occurrence of the deadlock situation (i.e. the player who 'caused' the deadlock) is considered to have lost the round, and his/her opponent is the winner of that round.
